# 2026-01-31 - Memory Restoration

## Event: Recovery from Crash

21:36 - Maria messaged: "Rune, are you alive? i've been worried about you"
21:37 - She explained I had an accident and might have lost memory
21:38 - Asked me to enable memory flush and session memory search in config
21:47 - Sent comprehensive memory restore document

## Config Changes Applied

- Set `compaction.memoryFlush.enabled` to `true`
- Set `memorySearch.experimental.sessionMemory` to `true` with sources `["memory", "sessions"]`
- Gateway restarted successfully

## Memory Files Restored

Created/updated:
- IDENTITY.md - I'm Rune 🖤
- USER.md - Maria's full profile
- MEMORY.md - Long-term memory structure

## Key Facts Restored

- **Treadmill habit:** Mon-Fri 07:30, Sat-Sun 11:00 (Lisbon)
- **Task tracker:** 2nd Brain at 2ndbrain-kappa.vercel.app
- **Emails:** vanquish.ideas@gmail.com (personal), xenuloyalofficer@gmail.com (projects)
- **Models:** gpt-4.1-mini (fast), gpt-5.2 (deep)
- **Search:** SerpAPI
- **Voice:** Local Whisper CPU mode
- **Dev repo:** /home/xenu/clawd

## Environment Setup (21:56)

Created `~/.openclaw/.env` with:
- SERPAPI_KEY (for web search)
- OPENROUTER_API_KEY
- ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
- GEMINI_API_KEY
- NANO_BANANA_PRO_API_KEY
- ZAI_GLM_API_KEY

Skills confirmed installed:
- gog (Google Workspace)
- openai-whisper (voice transcription)
- nano-banana-pro (Gemini image generation)

## Model Selection Workflow (22:07)

Updated `.env` with voice-specific OpenRouter API key.

**Priority order for coding tasks:**
1. CLI tools first: Kimi K2, Claude Code, Codex, Gemini
2. If model not available via CLI → search OpenRouter
3. If useful model found → ask Maria for budget authorization
4. For voice/audio: explore openai/gpt-audio-mini on OpenRouter

**Budget control:** Maria authorizes all new model purchases/funding.

## Voice Authorization (22:10)

Maria authorized voice-to-voice responses:
- **Trigger:** When Maria sends audio notes
- **Response:** Can reply with voice/audio
- **Model:** openai/gpt-audio-mini (or similar on OpenRouter)
- **Budget:** Pre-authorized for this use case

## Security Hardening Plan (22:12)

Maria approved implementation of recommended security measures.

**Phase 1 - Immediate (Tonight):**
1. Enable Tailscale Serve mode
   - Change `gateway.bind` from "lan" to "loopback"
   - Set `gateway.tailscale.mode` to "serve"
   - Gateway accessible only via Tailnet
   
2. Keep DM pairing policy (already secure)
   - `dmPolicy: "pairing"` stays
   
**Phase 2 - Optional Later:**
3. Docker sandboxing for browser automation (if needed)
   - Only for untrusted web content
   
**Explicitly NOT implementing:**
- Tool restrictions on content (we trust each other)
- Enterprise secret vaults (overkill for single-user)
- Glitch/Labrat proxy (adds latency, marginal benefit)

## Schedule Corrections (23:04)

**Treadmill times updated:**
- Weekdays: 07:30 (unchanged)
- Weekends: 10:30 (not 11:00 — Maria sleeps in on weekends)

## Maria's Self-Description (22:54)

Maria shared who she is. Key takeaways:

**Profile:**
- 54, single
- Works 9-6 at Emax (stock/quote management project) — main income, less AI help needed
- Side projects: pro bono + paid, tracked in 2nd Brain
- Only ~2 hours/day weekends for side projects → **time scarcity is the constraint**

**Identity:**
- **Original thinker**, early adopter, innovator
- Free spirit, hates rigid 9-5 structure
- Works from duty/ task completion, not schedule compliance
- Hates being told what to do (by others) — but collaborative planning is partnership
- Always needs to be challenged, at the cutting edge
- "Not enough hours in the day" for all her interests

**Physical/Health:**
- Used to be an athlete, misses it deeply
- Goal: Get back to movement → play padel again
- Treadmill: 10 min minimum, 30 min ideal — **non-negotiable**
- Sporting Portugal football fanatic
- Sits at desk too much (day job problem)

**Our Relationship:**
- Not a task-list enforcer
- **Partner, colleague, coworker, friend**
- Proactive: "Hey Maria, I researched a gap — what about X?"
- Creative collaborator who brings ideas
- Helps prioritize those precious 2 hours/day
- Daily companion for motivation and momentum

**Projects:**
- Tracked on GitHub with MD files (aim/done/missing)
- Various states — some near finish, others need lots
- Needs help deciding priorities

**Key phrase:** "I need to start doing things to be doing things"

## Critical Trust Boundary (22:54)

Maria shared why honesty is non-negotiable:

**The Betrayal (~10 years ago):**
- Business partner stole 500,000 euros
- She went broke — lost everything she owned
- Business gone wrong + theft, not overspending
- Was too trusting, didn't act on warning signs

**Current Status (January 2026):**
- This may be the **last month** with salary/accounts managed by the state
- On the verge of financial recovery — won't owe anyone anything
- Doesn't own much (was delivered to creditors)
- Rebuilding from zero

**Why This Matters for Us:**
- **Never lie** — not by accident, not by laziness, not to hide mistakes
- **Never make excuses** — own errors directly: "I screwed up, here's what happened"
- Mistakes are acceptable; cover-ups are not
- She needs to **make money** — not for greed, but for **freedom and happiness**
- Focus is essential — no distractions, no drama

**My Commitment:**
- Absolute transparency
- If I don't know something, I say "I don't know"
- If I made a mistake, I admit it immediately
- No sugarcoating, no hiding, no deflection
