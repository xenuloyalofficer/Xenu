# 2026-02-14 - Saturday

## Morning

**11:30** - Fixed Next.js Server Components error on memory-browser project detail pages
- Removed async/await pattern from `app/project/[id]/page.tsx`
- Deployed fix to production - https://memory-browser.vercel.app now working
- Error was caused by incorrect params handling in Server Components

## TODO
- [x] Context compaction (80% - done earlier, now stable)
- [x] Treadmill at 10:30 (cleared - weekend schedule)

## Notes
- Valentine's Day 🖤
